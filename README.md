# Portable videogame
Overview:
The project was worked on in pairs, each group built a videogame using
the ILI9341 LCD screen.

In this game we implemented everything learned throughout the course, we achieved this by using the screen and coded the game from the TivaC platform.
It was a local multiplayer game of pong which had two potentiometers as controls and two pushbuttons to reset the game and interact with the GUI.

It also used an SD card as storage medium instead of the platform memory. Finally, it incorporated 8-bit sound, making use of a passive buzzer
and pwm signals.
